## Hello there!

I'm Marc Cámara, a developer and technical lead based in [Andorra La Vella](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p6Ev74iAdQxowSiK8). 

I'm passionate about modern system design and creating scalable, optimized products that hold up in real production environments.

Currently, I'm working on web3 prototypes and API services using Rust and/or Ruby on Rails (but mostly Rust nowadays 🦀🦀🦀).

I’m also spending a lot of time on AI, particularly agentic systems, LLM-based applications, and RAG architectures. I’m not just consuming tools, I build custom chatbots, experiment with fine-tuning, and adapt models to specific, real-world use cases.

When I'm not coding, I spend time with my family (a son, a daughter, and a fabulous wife), playing videogames (especially retro ones 🕹️), doing sports (running, pádel, or hitting the gym 💪), and watching basketball (European basketball, not a big fan of the current state of the NBA).

My open source packages have been downloaded over 8 million times, with [laravel-localization](https://github.com/mcamara/laravel-localization) being one of the most notable contributions to the Laravel ecosystem (though I'm no longer actively maintaining it). 📦

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you want to collaborate! ⚡
